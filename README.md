StatusBarSymbols
=========================

A sublime text 3 plugin that shows the symbol name from your source code in the sublime statusbar depending on the cursor position.

StatusBarSymbols curently only supports files with the Python syntax but more language syntax are coming.

StatusBarSymbols smartly displays the symbol of the method or class that your cursor is positioned at.
